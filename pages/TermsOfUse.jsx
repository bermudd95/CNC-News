        In the unlikely event that you’re not satisfied with customer service’s
        solution, and you and CNC are unable to resolve a dispute through the
        Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve
        the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of
        in courts of general jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a
        neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited
        discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by
        courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision,
        arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can
        award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an
        individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not
        permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees
        from us to the same extent as you would be in court.
      </p>
      <h3 className='text-lg font-bold pb-5'>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h3>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by
        applicable law, CNC and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims
        between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain
        to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual
        property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our
        licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is
        intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        • claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship
        between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or
        any other statutory or common-law legal theory;
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        • claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but
        not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        • claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of
        physical bodily injury;
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        • claims that are currently the subject of purported class action
        litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>• claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        References to “CNC,” “you,” “we” and “us” in this Arbitration Agreement
        include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and
        assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents,
        subsidiaries and affiliates (including Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and
        its affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees,
        licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or
        our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or
        beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims
        heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long
        as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general
        jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from
        bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.
        <span className='font-bold'>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each
        waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by
        jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</span> This Agreement
        evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal
        Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) governs the interpretation and
        enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement
        shall survive termination of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        (2) <span className='font-bold'>Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution
        Procedures:</span> You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to
        resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and
        mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate
        arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the
        other a written Notice of Dispute <span className='font-bold'>(“Notice”)</span>. A Notice from you to CNC
        must be emailed to notice@wbd.com <span className='font-bold'>(“Notice Address”)</span>. Any Notice must
        include (i) the claimant’s name, address, and email address; (ii) a
        description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if
        you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of
        the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive
        any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of
        the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the
        damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a
        personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel)
        verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be
        individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other
        person’s dispute.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good
        faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can
        be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the
        completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized telephone
        or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day
        period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if
        represented). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if
        represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the
        earliest mutually-convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If
        we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in
        the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a
        longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an
        arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted
        by small claims court rules).
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal
        Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to
        initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including
        statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled
        while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures
        set forth in this Subsection 12.2. All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration
        Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that
        you and CNC have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes
        informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a
        court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of
        an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration
        administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in
        connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without
        completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute
        Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall
        be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right
        of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in
        arbitration.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        (3)<span className='font-bold'>Arbitration Procedure:</span> The arbitration will be governed by
        applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”) (including
        <span className='font-bold underline pl-1'><a href='https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Comprehensive-Rules-as-of-4.18.2022.pdf'>the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures</a></span> and/or

        Rules”)), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be
        administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so,
        another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will
        do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative
        administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §5.) The NAM Rules are
        available online at <span className='font-bold underline'><a href='http://www.namadr.com/'>www.namadr.com</a></span>, by calling NAM at 1-800-358-2550, or
        by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a
        form to initiate arbitration at:

        or by contacting NAM.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        You and we agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a
        certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory
        Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures
        requirements referenced in Section 12.2 and that they are a party to the
        Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for
        arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be
        personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their
        counsel, if represented).
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise
        expressly provided herein and except as to issues relating to the scope
        and enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement or whether a dispute can
        or must be brought in arbitration (including whether a dispute is
        subject to this Arbitration Agreement or a previous arbitration
        provision between you and CNC), which are for a court of competent
        jurisdiction to decide. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be
        bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate
        otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or
        parish) of your billing address and you and a CNC representative will be
        required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration
        proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision
        sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
        the award is based. The arbitrator’s decision is binding only between
        you and CNC and will not have any preclusive effect in another
        arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An
        arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in
        any court.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        As in court, you and CNC agree that any counsel representing a party in
        arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that
        they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil
        Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought
        is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator
        is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule
        of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all
        appropriate represented parties and counsel.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the
        arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties
        could have received in court, including awards of attorneys’ fees and
        costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by
        applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and
        costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds
        that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief
        sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by
        the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        (4) <span className='font-bold'>Arbitration Fees:</span> The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed
        by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and
        hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you
        qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any
        potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the
        arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation,
        we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the
        arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration
        from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the
        arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were
        frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith.
        You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all
        parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction
        or deferral of fees.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        (5) <span className='font-bold'>Confidentiality:</span> Upon either party’s request, the arbitrator will
        issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party
        disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may
        not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a
        proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court
        filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the
        furthest extent permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        (6) <span className='font-bold'>Offer of Settlement:</span> In any arbitration between you and CNC, the
        defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement
        offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive
        motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The
        amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the
        arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If
        the award is issued in the other party’s favor and is less than the
        defending party’s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending
        party’s favor, the other party must pay the defending party’s costs
        incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney’s fees. If any
        applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred
        in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to
        cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the
        claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        (7) <span className='font-bold'>Requirement of Individualized Relief:</span> The arbitrator may award
        declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
        seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
        warranted by that party’s individual claim. <span className='font-bold'>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
        PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS
        AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
        PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR
        PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING.</span> Further, unless both you and we
        agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
        person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
        representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after
        exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on
        non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class,
        representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation
        are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with
        respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for
        injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the
        parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a
        court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and
        requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations
        between you and CNC will be subject to this Section 12 and not to any
        prior arbitration agreement you had with CNC, and, notwithstanding any
        provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section

        contrary, if CNC makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement
        (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such
        change by sending CNC an email to notice@wbd.com within 30 days of the
        posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your
        full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone
        number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated

        purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement,
        personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the
        Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.

      <h3 className='font-bold pb-5'>(9) Mass Filing:</h3>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or
        seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the
        other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or
        entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings
        (“Mass Filing”) set forth in NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute
        Resolution Rules and Procedures (“NAM’s Mass Filing Rules,” available at
        https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree
        that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties
        agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer
        to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular
        needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by
        electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their
        dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including
        statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled
        beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute
        Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration
        Notice complies with the requirements in Section 12.2, until your claim
        is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled,
        withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        <span className='font-bold'>Stage One:</span> Counsel for the claimants and counsel for CNC shall each
        select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed
        in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these
        individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single
        arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining
        claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall
        any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless
        and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration
        proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of
        staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a
        global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal
        or state court judge and CNC shall pay the mediator’s fee.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        <span className='font-bold'>Stage Two:</span> If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time,
        counsel for the claimants and counsel for CNC shall each select 50
        claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in
        individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to
        any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these
        individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single
        arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining
        claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall
        any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless
        and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration
        proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged
        proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global
        mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or
        state court judge and CNC shall pay the mediator’s fee.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        <span className='font-bold'>Stage Three:</span> If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time,
        counsel for the claimants and counsel for CNC shall each select 100
        claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in
        individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to
        any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining
        claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall
        any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless
        and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration
        proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of
        staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties
        participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a
        retired federal or state court judge.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        If your claim is not resolved as part of the staged process identified
        above, either:
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        <span className='font-bold'>Option One:</span> You and CNC may separately or by agreement, opt out of
        arbitration and elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with
        the Agreement. You may opt out of arbitration by providing your
        individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out by
        sending CNC an email to notice@wbd.com. Such an opt-out email must be
        sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else
        purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement,
        personally signed by you, that you wish to opt out of arbitration within
        30 days after the conclusion of Stage 3 or the elective mediation
        associated with Stage 3. CNC may opt your claim out of arbitration by
        sending an individual, personally signed notice of its intention to opt
        out to your counsel within 14 days after the expiration of your 30 day
        opt out period. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these
        deadlines.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>OR</p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        <span className='font-bold'>Option Two:</span> If neither you nor CNC elect to have your claim heard in
        court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your claim will be
        resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration
        proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims
        exceeds 200, then 200 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected
        through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and
        to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If
        the number of remaining claims is fewer than 200, then all of those
        claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any
        remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration,
        nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those
        claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual
        arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of
        200 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved,
        this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for
        the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation,
        and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural
        Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims,
        increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote
        efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce
        these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass
        filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the
        assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to
        your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they
        are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a
        court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        You and CNC agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of
        arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of
        genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and CNC acknowledge and
        agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are
        followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass
        Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an
        efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.

      <p className='pb-5'>
        (10) <span className='font-bold'>Severability:</span> If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found
        to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall
        be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid,
        enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of
        the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The
        remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable
        and valid according to the terms contained herein.

      <h3 className='text-lg font-bold pb-5'>13. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER</h3>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        You and CNC agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each
        party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the
        other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a
        plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective,
        consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding.
         This means that you and CNC may not bring a claim on behalf of a class
        or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless
        doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar
        capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own
        individual claim.  This also means that you and CNC may not participate
        in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or
        representative proceeding brought by any third party.  Notwithstanding
        the foregoing, you or CNC may participate in a class-wide settlement.

      <p className='pb-5'>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and CNC waive any right to a
        jury trial.

        of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. If any part of these
        Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid
        or unenforceable, it will be replaced with language reflecting the
